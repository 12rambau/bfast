Quick Overview
==============

The bfast package provides an efficient massively-parallel implementation for the `Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFASTmonitor) <http://bfast.r-forge.r-project.org>`_ approach proposed by Verbesselt et al. The implementation is based on `OpenCL <https://www.khronos.org/opencl>`_ and allows to process large-scale change detection scenarios given satellite time series data.
