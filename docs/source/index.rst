Break Detection for Additive Season and Trend
=============================================
The bfast package provides a highly-efficient parallel implementation for the `Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFASTmonitor) <http://bfast.r-forge.r-project.org>`_ proposed by Verbesselt et al. The implementation is based on `OpenCL <https://www.khronos.org/opencl>`_ and allows to process large-scale change detection scenarios given satellite time series data.
